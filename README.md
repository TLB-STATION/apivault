---

## Authentication

```bash
apivault login
```

1. Opens your default browser to an **Approve / Refuse** prompt on ApiVault.
2. If you're not already signed in, you'll be redirected to log in first.
3. The CLI waits in the terminal until approval is detected (override with `--timeout <seconds>`), then saves an API token under `~/.apivault/token.json`.

```bash
apivault whoami                    # check connection status
apivault logout                    # revoke this device's token
```

### Token expiry

Tokens issued by the approval flow **expire 90 days after they are minted**. `apivault login` prints the expiry date once the connection succeeds, and `apivault whoami` shows it on every run — highlighted as a warning when fewer than 14 days remain:

```bash
apivault whoami
# ✔ Signed in as you@example.com
#   Token expires 12/9/2026.

apivault --json whoami | jq -r .tokenExpiresAt   # ISO date, or null for tokens
                                                 # saved before expiry tracking
```

Once a token lapses, commands report the date it expired instead of a bare `Unauthorized`; run `apivault login` to issue a fresh one. Tokens can also be revoked at any time from **Settings → Sessions & Devices** in the web app.

---

## Managing Projects & Local Directory Bindings

```bash
apivault projects list             # list all available projects (ID and slug)
apivault projects use <id|slug>    # bind current directory to a project (.apivault.json)
apivault link <id|slug>            # shortcut to bind current directory
apivault projects current          # check active project and resolution source
apivault unlink                    # remove local project binding
```

Anywhere a project is named — the `-p/--project` flag, `APIVAULT_PROJECT`, or the `project` config value — you can pass either the project **ID** or its **slug** (the name in your project URL, `apivault.tech/<username>/<slug>`). `apivault projects list` prints both.

For commands that require a project context, the CLI resolves the active project in this order:
1. `--project <id|slug>` or `-p <id|slug>` flag (available on all commands)
2. `APIVAULT_PROJECT` environment variable
3. Local directory configuration (`.apivault.json`, `.apivaultrc`, `apivault.json`)
4. Global default project (`apivault projects use <id|slug> --global` or `~/.apivault/config.json`)


---

## Managing API Keys

```bash
apivault keys list                 # list stored keys (masked)
apivault keys add                  # interactive wizard
apivault keys get <id>             # show key metadata
apivault keys get <id> --reveal    # decrypt and display raw value
apivault keys update <id>          # edit key attributes
apivault keys delete <id>          # confirm, then delete
apivault keys delete <id> -f       # skip confirmation
```

For automation, pass all values as flags:

```bash
apivault keys add \
  --name STRIPE_SECRET \
  --service Stripe \
  --environment Production \
  --key "sk_live_51M..." \
  --notes "Production payment gateway"
```

### Custom Encryption Vault Key

Accounts with a **custom vault key** (Settings → Encryption Key) need the vault key for encrypt/decrypt operations. The CLI resolves it in order:

1. `--vault-key "<vault-key>"` flag
2. `APIVAULT_KEY` environment variable
3. Stored config value (`apivault config set vaultKey`)
4. Interactive hidden prompt (fallback)

Accounts using default encryption need no vault key.

#### Attempt limits

Wrong vault keys are throttled server-side: **10 failed attempts per 15 minutes**, counted per user and per source address. Only requests that actually carry a vault key count, and a correct key clears the counter, so normal use never reaches the limit. Once it trips, the API answers `429` with a `Retry-After` header and the CLI reports how long to wait — re-running the same wrong key only extends the wait.

---

## Injecting Secrets (`apivault run`)

Decrypt all keys for an environment and inject them as environment variables into a child process — **no `.env` files written to disk**.

```bash
# Inject Production secrets into npm start
apivault run --env Production -- npm start

# Inject Staging secrets into Python / Node
apivault run --env Staging -- python main.py
```

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--env <name>` | Vault environment to pull secrets from |
| `--vault-key <vault-key>` | Custom encryption vault key |

During execution, existing local `.env` files are temporarily renamed to `*.apivault-run-hidden` to prevent framework conflicts, and automatically restored on exit. If restoration fails (e.g. process killed), run `apivault env restore`.

Save defaults to skip flags:

```bash
apivault config set run.env Production
apivault config set run.command "npm run dev"
apivault run                               # uses saved defaults
```

---

## Dotenv Management (`apivault env`)

Export decrypted secrets to local `.env` files for frameworks that require them (Next.js, Vite, Docker Compose, etc.):

```bash
apivault env export --env Production               # write to .env (merge)
apivault env export --env Staging -o .env.local     # custom output path
apivault env export --env Production --force        # overwrite instead of merge
```

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--env <name>` | Vault environment to export |
| `-o, --output <path>` | Target file (default: `.env`) |
| `-f, --force` | Replace file entirely instead of merging |
| `--vault-key <vault-key>` | Custom encryption vault key |

Restore hidden dotenv backups:

```bash
apivault env restore                        # current directory
apivault env restore -C /path/to/project    # specify project directory
```

---

## Local & Global Configuration
 
Manage CLI defaults stored per-project in `.apivault.json` or globally in `~/.apivault/config.json`:
 
```bash
apivault config list                       # view active merged config (shows local vs global)
apivault config list --local               # view only local project config
apivault config list --global              # view only global user config
apivault config get run.command            # read a resolved value
apivault config set --local run.env Dev    # set local project default environment
apivault config set --local run.command "npm run dev"
apivault config set --global run.env Prod  # set global default environment
apivault config set vaultKey               # save vault key (hidden input)
apivault config delete --local run.env     # remove a local value
```

Known keys: `project`, `run.command`, `run.env`, `vaultKey`. Explicit flags and local configs always take precedence.


---

## Audit & Request Logs (`apivault logs`)

Every request against a project — from the web app, the CLI, or an MCP agent — is recorded with
its status, actor, and duration. `apivault logs` reads that history without leaving the terminal.

```bash
# Most recent entries for the active project
apivault logs

# Narrow it down
apivault logs --status error --source mcp
apivault logs --status 404 --method POST
apivault logs --event-type KEY_REVEALED --date 2026-09-01 --end-date 2026-09-10
apivault logs --search "/api/keys" -n 100

# Follow new entries as they arrive (Ctrl+C to stop)
apivault logs --follow
apivault logs tail --source cli

# Inspect one entry in full, including its details payload
apivault logs get <log-id>
```

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `-n, --limit <n>` | Entries to fetch (default 50, max 1000) |
| `--page <n>` | Page through results (default 1) |
| `-f, --follow` | Stream new entries in real time |
| `--status <s>` | `success`, `error`, or an HTTP code such as `200` / `404`. Repeatable |
| `--source <s>` | `cli`, `mcp`, `web`, or `api` |
| `--method <m>` | `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` |
| `--event-type <t>` | e.g. `KEY_REVEALED`, `KEY_ROTATED`, `KEY_CREATED` |
| `--user <userId>` | Restrict to one actor |
| `--key <idOrName>` | Entries touching one stored key |
| `--date` / `--end-date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` bounds |
| `--search <query>` | Matches log ID, endpoint, method, source, IP, event type, or actor |

`apivault logs get <id>` accepts an ID prefix, so the shortened ID shown in a table is enough.

With `--json`, `logs` prints the full response object (entries plus pagination), while `--follow`
emits one JSON object per line as entries arrive, suitable for piping into a log forwarder:

```bash
apivault --json logs -f | jq -c '{t: .createdAt, s: .status, e: .endpoint}'
```

A `--follow` stream rides out transient network errors, but stops and reports if the token has
expired or been revoked, the project became inaccessible, or a filter was rejected — so a broken
stream is never mistaken for a quiet one.

---

## JSON Output

Pass `--json` to any command for structured output suitable for `jq` or scripts:

```bash
apivault --json keys list | jq '.[] | {id: .id, name: .name}'
apivault --json keys get <id> --reveal | jq -r .rawKey | clip
```

---

## Security

| Layer | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Transport** | HTTPS with token-header authentication |
| **Local storage** | `~/.apivault/token.json` and `config.json` written with `0600` permissions (Unix) |
| **Process isolation** | Secrets exist only in child-process memory during `apivault run` — nothing written to disk |
| **Token lifetime** | Device tokens expire 90 days after approval, and can be revoked early from **Settings → Sessions & Devices** |
| **Throttling** | Wrong vault keys are rate limited server-side (10 per 15 minutes, per user and source address) |
